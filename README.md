# Prime Weekend Challenge 1

##Hey Primers!

For this weekend, you will be creating an application that will process insurance claims. You will be provided an array of 5 items, where you will use the constructor function to create 5 more, combining to the two to have one array of 10 items.  

You will need to create two functions, one will determine what percentage (per rules below) will be covered and another will determine what that amount will be (per the visitCost value). Within your cost determining method, console out a message in the format ('Paid out $______ for _______') where the second statement is the patient name. 

After that is complete, console out the entire amount paid out.

Numbers should be rounded to the nearest whole number!

###Rules
Optical - covers 0%

Specialist - covers 10%

Emergency - covers 100%

Primary Care - covers 50%
